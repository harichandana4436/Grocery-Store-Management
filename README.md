        * Primary keys and foreign keys

        * Proper constraints to maintain data integrity

* Key Features:

      * Normalized table structure

      * Referential integrity

      * Meaningful relationships between entities

## 📋 SQL Components Covered
### 1️⃣ Database Creation

   * Creation of database schema

   * Table definitions using CREATE TABLE

   * Use of appropriate data types

### 2️⃣ Constraints

  * PRIMARY KEY

  * FOREIGN KEY

  * NOT NULL

  * UNIQUE

  * CHECK

### 3️⃣ Data Insertion

  * Populating tables using INSERT INTO

  * Bulk data insertion

  * Sample real-world records

### 4️⃣ Data Retrieval (Queries)

  * The project includes a wide range of SQL queries such as:

        * SELECT statements

        * WHERE conditions

        * ORDER BY

        * GROUP BY

        * HAVING

 * Aggregate functions:

       * COUNT()

       * SUM()

       * AVG()

       * MIN()

       * MAX()

### 5️⃣ Joins

   * Demonstrated usage of:

         * INNER JOIN

         * LEFT JOIN

         * RIGHT JOIN

  * Used to retrieve meaningful combined data from multiple tables.

### 6️⃣ Subqueries

  * Nested queries

  * Correlated and non-correlated subqueries

  * Filtering data based on results of another query
### 7️⃣ Data Manipulation

    * UPDATE statements

    * DELETE statements

    * Conditional modifications
## 📊 Use Cases / Analysis

* This project answers practical business-style questions such as:

      * Identifying trends in data

      * Finding top-performing records

      * Calculating totals and averages

      * Filtering results based on conditions

      * Generating summarized reports
## ▶️ How to Run the Project

   * Open your SQL database tool (MySQL /SQL Server)

         * Create a new database

         * Import or run the file:

               - sql project.sql

         * Execute the queries step by step

         * View outputs in the query result panel
   ## 📈 Output
